# Nim2D

![](https://github.com/beshrkayali/nim2d/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

A pre-alpha minimal 2d game engine inspired by [love2d](https://love2d.org/). Using [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).

There's not much yet, but check `examples/all.nim` for an example that uses almost all of what's currently exposed.

Note: I'm using this project as a way to get my hands dirty with Nim and SDL2. Some things might be very wrong.
